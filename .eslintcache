The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided\n            by your mobile network provider, but Battle Koi\n            cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full\n            functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t\n            have any of your data allowance left.\n                </p> <p></p> <p>\n            If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you\n            should remember that your terms of the agreement with your\n            mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may\n            be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for\n            the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or\n            other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting\n            responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data\n            charges if you use the app outside of your home territory\n            (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.
